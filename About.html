    <h3 class="fulla">Full stack Development</h3>
    <p class="fullb">My name is <b>Shruthi Ranjani</b>, and I am a passionate full stack developer with a strong foundation in both <i>front-end</i> and <em>back-end</em> technologies. I specialize in building complete, responsive web applications that are efficient and user-friendly. On the front end, I work with modern frameworks like React and Angular to create engaging interfaces. On the back end, I utilize technologies such as Node.js, Python, and Java, managing databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL for optimal data performance Software developers require slightly different skills, tools, and software knowledge for frontend and backend development. However, full-stack development combines both disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. </p>

    <div class="end">
    <h3 class="enda">Front-End Developer</h3>
    <p class="endb">As a front-end developer, I design and build engaging, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces that deliver a seamless experience across all devices and browsers. I have strong expertise in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and I work with modern frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js to create dynamic, interactive applications.

I pay close attention to UI/UX principles, ensuring my designs are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and accessible. I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, maintainable code, using tools like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and SASS to create consistent, scalable styles.

Performance and responsiveness are priorities for me — I optimize assets, implement lazy loading, and follow best practices to ensure fast load times and smooth interactions. I also collaborate closely with designers and back-end developers to bring ideas to life and deliver high-quality products that users love.
</p>

    <div class="con">
    <h3 class="cona">Back-End Developer</h3>
    <p class="conb">As a back-end developer, I build and maintain the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power robust, scalable web applications. I work with technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Python, Java, and Spring Boot to develop secure and efficient server-side solutions. I design and implement RESTful APIs and microservices architectures to ensure smooth communication between the front end and the back end. I have experience managing both SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, designing schemas, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity. Security, performance, and reliability are at the core of my back-end development approach. I handle user authentication and authorization, manage server deployments, and use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. I also leverage cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform to deploy, monitor, and scale applications efficiently. My goal is to deliver robust back-end solutions that support seamless front-end experiences and can grow with evolving user needs.</p>
